# Caesar Cipher – Python Implementation 

This project implements the *Caesar Cipher algorithm* using Python.  
It allows users to *encrypt and decrypt text* by providing a message and a shift value.

## What is Caesar Cipher?
Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

*Example:*  
- Message: HELLO  
- Shift: 3  
- Encrypted: KHOOR
